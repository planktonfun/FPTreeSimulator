# FP-Tree Simulator

Online Demo [here](https://planktonfun.github.io/FPTreeSimulator/).

A simple animated page in JS to display how Frequent Pattern trees are formed 
from a list of frequent items. Accepts input in the form of newline-separated 
sets of itemsets, gets the frequent items depending on any provided min support 
value and generates an FP-tree from those items.

Uses [CSS3 Family Tree](http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/css3-family-tree).
